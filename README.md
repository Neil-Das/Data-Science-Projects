# Data-Science-Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository, where you can find two distinct data science projects: a drug classification model and a food truck weekend planner. 
This repository contains detailed information and code for each of these projects.

## Project 1: Drug Classification Model

### Overview
This project focuses on building a drug classification model using XGBoost.
The model takes several features, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and sodium to potassium ratio in the blood, and predicts one of six drugs. 

## Project 2: Food Truck Weekend Planner

### Overview
The Food Truck Weekend Planner project is designed for food enthusiasts who want to explore various food trucks in Indiana over a weekend. 
It scrapes data from the Yelp API, cleans the data, and then utilizes the Google Maps API to create a detailed two-day weekend plan, including three food truck options each day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner).
The routes for both days are visualized on an interactive map with the Folium package.
